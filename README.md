Buckler Lab for Maize Genetics and Diversity: https://www.maizegenetics.net/ <br>

My research questions: <br>
How are Mutator TEs conserved across maize genotypes and across the andropogoneae clade? And how does climate impact accumulation and distribution of Mutator TEs across both taxa? <br>

For each of ~270 maize inbreds, as well as active transposon lines BonnMu and UniformMu:

| Step | Description|
| ---- | -----------|
| 1 | Map short-read bam files to Mutator TE sequence |
| 2 | Blast bam files against Mutator TE sequence |
| 3 | Filter blast outputs, construct insertion matrix |
| 4 | Identify what gene region each insertion is inserting into |
| 5 | Result data exploration and visualization | <br>

** NOTE: Only a small sample of code used as part of this project is included in this repository. All scripts will be uploaded after findings are published.
