My research questions: <br>
How are Mutator TEs conserved across maize genotypes and across the andropogoneae clade? And how does climate impact accumulation and distribution of Mutator TEs across both taxa? <br>

For each of the ~270 maize inbreds:

| Step | Description|
| ---- | -----------|
| 1 | Map short-read bam files to Mutator TE sequence |
| 2 | Blast bam files against Mutator TE sequence |
| 3 | Filter blast outputs, construct insertion matrix |
| 4 | Identify what gene region each insertion is inserting into |
| 5 | Result data exploration and visualization |
